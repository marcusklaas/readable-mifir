   of 15 May 2014<br/>on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012<br/>(Text with EEA relevance)</h1>

   <p>THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
   <p>Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,</p>
   <p>Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,</p>
   <p>After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,</p>
   <p>Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank<a href="#ntr1-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0001" id="ntc1-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0001" shape="rect">&nbsp;(<span class="super">1</span>)</a>,</p>

   <p>Whereas:</p>

   <ol>
        <li>
               <p>The financial crisis has exposed weaknesses in the transparency of financial markets which can contribute to harmful socioeconomic effects. Strengthening transparency is one of the shared principles to strengthen the financial system as confirmed by the G20 Leaders&rsquo; statement in London on 2 April 2009. In order to strengthen the transparency and improve the functioning of the internal market for financial instruments, a new framework establishing uniform requirements for the transparency of transactions in markets for financial instruments should be put in place. The framework should establish comprehensive rules for a broad range of financial instruments. It should complement requirements for the transparency of orders and transactions in respect of shares established in Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council<a href="#ntr4-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0004" id="ntc4-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0004" shape="rect">&nbsp;(<span class="super">4</span>)</a>.</p>
        </li><li>

               <p>The High-Level Group on Financial Supervision in the EU chaired by Jacques de Larosi&egrave;re invited the Union to develop a more harmonised set of financial regulations. In the context of the future European supervision architecture, the European Council of 18 and 19 June 2009 stressed the need to establish a European single rule book applicable to all financial institutions in the internal market.</p>
        </li><li>

               <p>The new legislation should as a consequence consist of two different legal instruments, a Directive and this Regulation. Together, both legal instruments should form the legal framework governing the requirements applicable to investment firms, regulated markets and data reporting services providers. This Regulation should therefore be read together with the Directive. The need to establish a single set of rules for all institutions in respect of certain requirements and to avoid potential regulatory arbitrage as well as to provide more legal certainty and less regulatory complexity for market participants warrants the use of a legal basis allowing for the creation of a Regulation. In order to remove the remaining obstacles to trade and significant distortions of competition resulting from divergences between national laws and to prevent any further likely obstacles to trade and significant distortions of competition from arising, it is therefore necessary to adopt a Regulation establishing uniform rules applicable in all Member States. This directly applicable legal act aims at contributing in a determining manner to the smooth functioning of the internal market and should, consequently, be based on Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), as interpreted in accordance with the consistent case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.</p>
        </li><li>
               <p>Directive 2004/39/EC established rules for making the trading in shares admitted to trading on a regulated market pre-trade and post-trade transparent and for reporting transactions in financial instruments admitted to trading on a regulated market to competent authorities. The directive needs to be recast in order to appropriately reflect developments in financial markets and to address weaknesses and close loopholes that were, inter alia, exposed in the financial market crisis.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>Provisions in respect of trade and regulatory transparency requirements need to take the form of directly applicable law applied to all investment firms that should follow uniform rules in all Union markets, in order to provide for a uniform application of a single regulatory framework, to strengthen confidence in the transparency of markets across the Union, to reduce regulatory complexity and investment firms&rsquo; compliance costs, especially for financial institutions operating on a cross-border basis, and to contribute to the elimination of distortions of competition. The adoption of a regulation ensuring direct applicability is best suited to accomplish those regulatory goals and ensure uniform conditions by preventing diverging national requirements as a result of the transposition of a directive.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>It is important to ensure that trading in financial instruments is carried out as far as possible on organised venues and that all such venues are appropriately regulated. Under Directive 2004/39/EC, some trading systems developed which were not adequately captured by the regulatory regime. Any trading system in financial instruments, such as entities currently known as broker crossing networks, should in the future be properly regulated and be authorised under one of the types of multilateral trading venues or as a systematic internaliser under the conditions set out in this Regulation and in Directive 2014/65/EU<a href="#ntr5-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0005" id="ntc5-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0005" shape="rect">&nbsp;(<span class="super">5</span>)</a>.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>The definitions of regulated market and multilateral trading facility (MTF) should be clarified and remain closely aligned with each other to reflect the fact that they represent effectively the same organised trading functionality. The definitions should exclude bilateral systems where an investment firm enters into every trade on own account, even as a riskless counterparty interposed between the buyer and seller. Regulated markets and MTFs should not be allowed to execute client orders against proprietary capital. The term &lsquo;system&rsquo; encompasses all those markets that are composed of a set of rules and a trading platform as well as those that only function on the basis of a set of rules. Regulated markets and MTFs are not obliged to operate a &lsquo;technical&rsquo; system for matching orders and should be able to operate other trading protocols including systems whereby users are able to trade against quotes they request from multiple providers. A market which is only composed of a set of rules that governs aspects related to membership, admission of instruments to trading, trading between members, reporting and, where applicable, transparency obligations is a regulated market or an MTF within the meaning of this Regulation and the transactions concluded under those rules are considered to be concluded under the systems of a regulated market or an MTF. The term &lsquo;buying and selling interests&rsquo; is to be understood in a broad sense and includes orders, quotes and indications of interest.</p>
               <p>One of the important requirements concerns the obligation that the interests be brought together in the system by means of non-discretionary rules set by the system operator. That requirement means that they are brought together under the system&rsquo;s rules or by means of the system&rsquo;s protocols or internal operating procedures, including procedures embodied in computer software. The term &lsquo;non-discretionary rules&rsquo; means rules that leave the regulated market or the market operator or investment firm operating an MTF with no discretion as to how interests may interact. The definitions require that interests be brought together in such a way as to result in a contract which occurs where execution takes place under the system&rsquo;s rules or by means of the system&rsquo;s protocols or internal operating procedures.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>In order to make Union financial markets more transparent and efficient and to level the playing field between various venues offering multilateral trading services it is necessary to introduce a new trading venue category of organised trading facility (OTF) for bonds, structured finance products, emissions allowances and derivatives and to ensure that it is appropriately regulated and applies non-discriminatory rules regarding access to the facility. That new category is broadly defined so that now and in the future it should be able to capture all types of organised execution and arranging of trading which do not correspond to the functionalities or regulatory specifications of existing venues. Consequently, appropriate organisational requirements and transparency rules which support efficient price discovery need to be applied. The new category encompasses systems eligible for trading clearing-eligible and sufficiently liquid derivatives.</p>
               <p>It should not include facilities where there is no genuine trade execution or arranging taking place in the system, such as bulletin boards used for advertising buying and selling interests, other entities aggregating or pooling potential buying or selling interests, electronic post-trade confirmation services, or portfolio compression, which reduces non-market risks in existing derivatives portfolios without changing the market risk of the portfolios. Portfolio compression may be provided by a range of firms which are not regulated as such by this Regulation or by Directive 2014/65/EU, such as central counterparties (CCPs), trade repositories as well as by investment firms or market operators. It is appropriate to clarify that where investment firms and market operators carry out portfolio compression certain provisions of this Regulation and of Directive 2014/65/EU are not applicable in relation to portfolio compression. Since central securities depositories (CSDs) will be subject to the same requirements as investment firms when providing certain investment services or performing certain investment activities, the provisions of this Regulation and of Directive 2014/65/EU should not be applicable to firms that are not regulated thereby when carrying out portfolio compression.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>That new category OTF will complement the existing types of trading venues. While regulated markets and MTFs have non-discretionary rules for the execution of transactions, the operator of an OTF should carry out order execution on a discretionary basis subject, where applicable, to the pre-transparency requirements and best execution obligations. Consequently, conduct of business rules, best execution and client order handling obligations should apply to the transactions concluded on an OTF operated by an investment firm or a market operator. In addition, any market operator authorised to operate an OTF should comply with Chapter 1 of Directive 2014/65/EU regarding conditions and procedures for authorisation of investment firms. The investment firm or the market operator operating an OTF should be able to exercise discretion at two different levels: first when deciding to place an order on the OTF or to retract it again and second when deciding not to match a specific order with the orders available in the system at a given point in time, provided that that complies with specific instructions received from clients and with best execution obligations.</p>
               <p>For the system that crosses client orders the operator should be able to decide if, when and how much of two or more orders it wants to match within the system. In accordance with Article 20(1), (2), (4) and (5) of Directive 2014/65/EU and without prejudice to Article 20(3) of Directive 2014/65/EU, the firm should be able to facilitate negotiation between clients as to bring together two or more potentially compatible trading interests in a transaction. At both discretionary levels the OTF operator must have regard to its obligations under Articles 18 and 27 of Directive 2014/65/EU. The market operator or investment firm operating an OTF should make clear to users of the venue how they will exercise discretion. Because an OTF constitutes a genuine trading platform, the platform operator should be neutral. Therefore, the investment firm or market operator operating the OTF should be subject to requirements in relation to non-discriminatory execution and neither the investment firm or market operator operating the OTF nor any entity that is part of the same group or legal person as the investment firm or market operator should be allowed to execute client orders in an OTF against its proprietary capital.</p>
               <p>For the purpose of facilitating the execution of one or more client orders in bonds, structured finance products, emission allowances and derivatives that have not been declared subject to the clearing obligation in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council<a href="#ntr6-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0006" id="ntc6-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0006" shape="rect">&nbsp;(<span class="super">6</span>)</a>, an OTF operator is permitted to use matched principal trading within the meaning of Directive 2014/65/EU provided the client has consented to that process. In relation to sovereign debt instruments for which there is not a liquid market, an investment firm or market operator operating an OTF should be able to engage in dealing on own account other than matched principal trading. When matched principal trading is used all pre-trade and post-trade transparency requirements as well as best execution obligations must be complied with. The OTF operator or any entity that is part of the same group or legal person as the investment firm or market operator should not act as systematic internaliser in the OTF operated by it. Furthermore, the operator of an OTF should be subject to the same obligations as an MTF in relation to the sound management of potential conflicts of interest.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>All organised trading should be conducted on regulated venues and be fully transparent, both pre and post trade. Appropriately calibrated transparency requirements therefore need to apply to all types of trading venues, and to all financial instruments traded thereon.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>In order to ensure more trading takes place on regulated trading venues and systematic internalisers, a trading obligation for shares admitted to trading on a regulated market or traded on a trading venue should be introduced for investment firms in this Regulation. That trading obligation requires investment firms to undertake all trades including trades dealt on own account and trades dealt when executing client orders on a regulated market, an MTF, a systematic internaliser or an equivalent third-country trading venue. However an exclusion from that trading obligation should be provided if there is a legitimate reason. Those legitimate reasons are where trades are non-systematic, ad-hoc, irregular and infrequent, or are technical trades such as give-up trades which do not contribute to the price discovery process. Such an exclusion from that trading obligation should not be used to circumvent the restrictions introduced on the use of the reference price waiver and the negotiated price waiver or to operate a broker crossing network or other crossing system.</p>
               <p>The option for trades to be done on a systematic internaliser is without prejudice to the systematic internaliser regime laid down in this Regulation. The intention is that if the investment firm itself meets the relevant criteria laid down in this Regulation to be deemed a systematic internaliser in that particular share, the trade may be dealt in that way; however, if it is not deemed a systematic internaliser in that particular share, the investment firm should still be able to undertake the trade on another systematic internaliser where that complies with its best execution obligations and the option is available to it. In addition, in order to ensure that multilateral trading with respect to shares, depositary receipts, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), certificates and other similar financial instruments is properly regulated, an investment firm that operates an internal matching system on a multilateral basis should be authorised as an MTF. It should be clarified that the best execution provisions set out in Directive 2014/65/EU should be applied in such a manner as not to impede the trading obligations under this Regulation.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>Trading in depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates, similar financial instruments and shares other than those admitted to trading on a regulated market takes place in largely the same fashion, and fulfils a nearly identical economic purpose, as trading in shares admitted to trading on a regulated market. Transparency provisions applicable to shares admitted to trading on regulated markets should thus be extended to those financial instruments.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>While, in principle, acknowledging the need for a regime of waivers from pre-trade transparency to support the efficient functioning of markets, the actual waiver provisions for shares applicable on the basis of Directive 2004/39/EC and of Commission Regulation (EC) No&nbsp;1287/2006<a href="#ntr7-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0007" id="ntc7-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0007" shape="rect">&nbsp;(<span class="super">7</span>)</a>, need to be scrutinised as to their continued appropriateness in terms of scope and conditions applicable. In order to ensure a uniform application of the waivers from pre-trade transparency in shares and eventually other similar financial instruments and non-equity products for specific market models and types and sizes of orders, the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority), established by Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council<a href="#ntr8-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0008" id="ntc8-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0008" shape="rect">&nbsp;(<span class="super">8</span>)</a> (&lsquo;ESMA&rsquo;), should assess the compatibility of individual requests for applying a waiver with rules laid down in this Regulation and in delegated acts provided for in this Regulation. ESMA&rsquo;s assessment should take the form of an opinion in accordance with Article 29 of Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;1095/2010. In addition, the already existing waivers for shares should be reviewed by ESMA within an appropriate timeframe and an assessment should be made, following the same procedure, as to whether they are still in compliance with the rules set out in this Regulation and in delegated acts provided for in this Regulation.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>The financial crisis exposed specific weaknesses in the way information on trading opportunities and prices in financial instruments other than shares is available to market participants, namely in terms of timing, granularity, equal access, and reliability. Timely pre-trade and post-trade transparency requirements taking account of the different characteristics and market structures of specific types of financial instruments other than shares should thus be introduced and calibrated for different types of trading systems, including order-book, quote-driven, hybrid, periodic auction trading and voice trading systems. In order to provide a sound transparency framework for all relevant financial instruments, these should apply to bonds, structured finance products, emission allowances and derivatives which are traded on a trading venue. Therefore, exemptions from pre-trade transparency and adaptations of the requirements in relation to deferred publication should be available only in certain defined cases.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>It is necessary to introduce an appropriate level of trade transparency in markets for bonds, structured finance products and derivatives in order to help the valuation of products as well as the efficiency of price formation. Structured finance products should, in particular, include asset backed securities as defined in Article 2(5) of Commission Regulation (EC) No&nbsp;809/2004<a href="#ntr9-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0009" id="ntc9-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0009" shape="rect">&nbsp;(<span class="super">9</span>)</a>, comprising among others collateralised debt obligations.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>In order to ensure uniform applicable conditions between trading venues, the same pre-trade and post-trade transparency requirements should apply to the different types of venues. The transparency requirements should be calibrated for different types of financial instruments, including equities, bonds, and derivatives, taking into account the interests of investors and issuers, including government bond issuers, and market liquidity. The requirements should be calibrated for different types of trading, including order-book and quote-driven systems such as request for quote as well as hybrid and voice broking systems, and take account of transaction size, including turnover, and other relevant criteria.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>In order to avoid any negative impact on the price formation process, it is necessary to introduce an appropriate volume cap mechanism for orders placed in systems which are based on a trading methodology by which the price is determined in accordance with a reference price and for certain negotiated transactions. That mechanism should have a double cap, whereby a volume cap is applied to each trading venue that uses those waivers so that only a certain percentage of trading can be done on each trading venue, and in addition an overall volume cap is applied which if exceeded would result in the suspension of use of those waivers across the Union. In relation to the negotiated transactions, it should only apply to those transactions that are made within the current volume weighted spread reflected on the order book or the quotes of the market makers of the trading venue operating that system. It should exclude negotiated transactions in illiquid shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates or other similar financial instruments, and those transactions that are subject to conditions other than the current market price as they do not contribute to the price formation process.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>In order to ensure that trading carried out OTC does not jeopardise efficient price discovery or a transparent level playing field between means of trading, appropriate pre-trade transparency requirements should apply to investment firms dealing on own account in financial instruments OTC insofar as it is carried out in their capacity as systematic internalisers in relation to shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates or other similar financial instruments for which there is a liquid market and bonds, structured finance products, emission allowances and derivatives which are traded on a trading venue and for which there is a liquid market.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>An investment firm executing client orders against own proprietary capital should be deemed a systematic internaliser, unless the transactions are carried out outside a trading venue on an occasional, ad hoc and irregular basis. Thus, systematic internalisers should be defined as investment firms which, on an organised, frequent systematic and substantial basis, deal on own account by executing client orders outside a trading venue. The requirements for systematic internalisers in this Regulation should apply to an investment firm only in relation to each single financial instrument, for example on ISIN-code level, in which it is a systematic internaliser. In order to ensure an objective and effective application of the definition of systematic internaliser to investment firms, there should be a pre-determined threshold for systematic internalisation containing an exact specification of what is meant by frequent, systematic and substantial basis.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>While an OTF is any system or facility in which multiple third-party buying and selling interests interact in the system, a systematic internaliser should not be allowed to bring together third-party buying and selling interests. For instance, a so-called single-dealer platform, where trading always takes place against a single investment firm, should be considered a systematic internaliser, were it to comply with the requirements included in this Regulation. However, a so-called multi-dealer platform, with multiple dealers interacting for the same financial instrument, should not be considered a systematic internaliser.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>Systematic internalisers should be able to decide on the basis of their commercial policy and in an objective non-discriminatory way the clients to whom they give access to their quotes, distinguishing between categories of clients, and should also be entitled to take account of distinctions between clients, for example in relation to credit risk. Systematic internalisers should not be obliged to publish firm quotes, execute client orders and give access to their quotes in relation to equity transactions above standard market size and non-equity transactions above the size specific to the financial instrument. Systematic internalisers&rsquo; compliance with their obligations should be checked by and information made available to competent authorities to enable them to do so.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>It is not the intention of this Regulation to require the application of pre-trade transparency rules to transactions carried out on an OTC basis, other than within a systematic internaliser.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>Market data should be easily and readily available to users in a format as disaggregated as possible to allow investors, and data service providers serving their needs, to customise data solutions to the furthest possible degree. Therefore, pre-trade and post-trade transparency data should be made available to the public in an &lsquo;unbundled&rsquo; fashion in order to reduce costs for market participants when purchasing data.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council<a href="#ntr10-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0010" id="ntc10-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0010" shape="rect">&nbsp;(<span class="super">10</span>)</a> and Regulation (EC) No&nbsp;45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council<a href="#ntr11-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0011" id="ntc11-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0011" shape="rect">&nbsp;(<span class="super">11</span>)</a> should be fully applicable to the exchange, transmission and processing of personal data for the purposes of this Regulation, particularly Title IV, by Member States and ESMA.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>Considering the agreement reached by the parties to the G20 Pittsburgh summit on 25 September 2009 to move trading in standardised OTC derivative contracts to exchanges or electronic trading platforms where appropriate, a formal regulatory procedure should be defined for mandating trading between financial counterparties and large non-financial counterparties in all derivatives which have been considered to be clearing-eligible and which are sufficiently liquid to take place on a range of trading venues subject to comparable regulation and enabling participants to trade with multiple counterparties. The assessment of sufficient liquidity should take account of market characteristics at national level including elements such as the number and type of market participants in a given market, and of transaction characteristics, such as the size and frequency of transactions in that market.</p>
               <p>A liquid market in a product class of derivatives will be characterised by a high number of active market participants, including a suitable mix of liquidity providers and liquidity takers, relative to the number of traded products, which execute trades frequently in those products in sizes below a size that is large in scale. Such market activity should be indicated by a high number of resting bids and offers in the relevant derivative leading to a narrow spread for a transaction of normal market size. The assessment of sufficient liquidity should recognize that the liquidity of a derivative can vary significantly according to market conditions and its life cycle.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>Considering the agreement reached by the parties to the G20 in Pittsburgh on 25 September 2009 to move trading in standardised OTC derivative contracts to exchanges or electronic trading platforms where appropriate on the one hand, and the relatively lower liquidity of various OTC derivatives on the other, it is appropriate to provide for a suitable range of eligible venues on which trading pursuant to that commitment can take place. All eligible venues should be subject to closely aligned regulatory requirements in terms of organisational and operational aspects, arrangements to mitigate conflicts of interest, surveillance of all trading activity, pre-trade and post-trade transparency calibrated by financial instrument and types of trading system, and for multiple third-party trading interests to be able to interact with one another. The possibility for operators of venues to arrange transactions pursuant to that commitment between multiple third parties in a discretionary fashion should however be provided for in order to improve the conditions for execution and liquidity.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>The obligation to conclude transactions in derivatives pertaining to a class of derivatives that has been declared subject to the trading obligation on a regulated market, MTF, OTF or third country trading venue should not apply to the components of non-price forming post-trade risk reduction services which reduce non-market risks in derivatives portfolios including existing OTC derivatives portfolios in accordance with Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012 without changing the market risk of the portfolios. In addition, while it is appropriate to make specific provision for portfolio compression, this Regulation is not intended to prevent the use of other post-trade risk reduction services.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>The trading obligation established for those derivatives should allow for efficient competition between eligible trading venues. Therefore those trading venues should not be able to claim exclusive rights in relation to any derivatives subject to that trading obligation preventing other trading venues from offering trading in those financial instruments. For effective competition between trading venues for derivatives, it is essential that trading venues have non-discriminatory and transparent access to CCPs. Non-discriminatory access to a CCP should mean that a trading venue has the right to non-discriminatory treatment in terms of how contracts traded on its platform are treated in terms of collateral requirements and netting of economically equivalent contracts and cross-margining with correlated contracts cleared by the same CCP, and non-discriminatory clearing fees.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>Competent authorities&rsquo; powers should be complemented with an explicit mechanism for prohibiting or restricting the marketing, distribution and sale of any financial instrument or structured deposit giving rise to serious concerns regarding investor protection, orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets, or commodities markets, or the stability of the whole or part of the financial system, together with appropriate coordination and contingency powers for ESMA or, for structured deposits, the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (EBA), established by Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council<a href="#ntr12-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0012" id="ntc12-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0012" shape="rect">&nbsp;(<span class="super">12</span>)</a>. The exercise of such powers by competent authorities and, in exceptional cases, by ESMA or EBA should be subject to the need to fulfil a number of specific conditions. Where those conditions are met, the competent authority or, in exceptional cases, ESMA or EBA should be able to impose a prohibition or restriction on a precautionary basis before a financial instrument or structured deposit has been marketed, distributed or sold to clients.</p>
               <p>Those powers do not imply any requirement to introduce or apply a product approval or licensing by the competent authority, ESMA or EBA, and do not relieve investment firms of their responsibility to comply with the all relevant requirements laid down in this Regulation and in Directive 2014/65/EU. The orderly functioning and integrity of commodity markets should be included as a criterion for intervention by competent authorities in order to enable action to be taken to counteract possible negative externalities on commodities markets from activities on financial markets. This is true, in particular, for agricultural commodity markets the purpose of which is to ensure a secure supply of food for the population. In those cases, the measures should be coordinated with the authorities competent for the commodity markets concerned.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>Competent authorities should notify ESMA of the details of any of their requests to reduce a position in relation to a derivative contract, of any one-off limits, as well as of any <span class="italic">ex-ante</span> position limits in order to improve coordination and convergence in how those powers are applied. The essential details of any <span class="italic">ex-ante</span> position limits applied by a competent authority should be published on ESMA&rsquo;s website.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>ESMA should be able to request information from any person regarding their position in relation to a derivative contract, to request that position to be reduced, as well as to limit the ability of persons to undertake individual transactions in relation to commodity derivatives. ESMA should then notify relevant competent authorities of measures it proposes to undertake and should publish those measures.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>The details of transactions in financial instruments should be reported to competent authorities to enable them to detect and investigate potential cases of market abuse, to monitor the fair and orderly functioning of markets, as well as the activities of investment firms. The scope of that oversight includes all financial instruments which are traded on a trading venue and financial instruments where the underlying is a financial instrument traded on a trading venue or where the underlying is an index or basket composed of financial instruments traded on a trading venue. The obligation should apply whether or not such transactions in any of those financial instruments were carried out on a trading venue. In order to avoid an unnecessary administrative burden on investment firms, financial instruments that are not susceptible to market abuse should be excluded from the reporting obligation. The reports should use a legal entity identifier in line with the G-20 commitments. ESMA should report to the Commission on the functioning of such reporting to the competent authorities and the Commission should take steps to propose any changes where appropriate.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>The operator of a trading venue should provide its competent authority with relevant financial instrument reference data. Those notifications are to be transmitted by the competent authorities without delay to ESMA, which should publish them immediately on its website to enable ESMA and competent authorities to use, analyse and exchange transaction reports.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>In order to serve their purpose as a tool for market monitoring, transaction reports should identify the person who has made the investment decision, as well as those responsible for its execution. In addition to the transparency regime provided for in Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;236/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council<a href="#ntr13-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0013" id="ntc13-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0013" shape="rect">&nbsp;(<span class="super">13</span>)</a>, the marking of short sales provides useful supplementary information to enable competent authorities to monitor levels of short selling. Competent authorities need to have full access to records at all stages in the order execution process, from the initial decision to trade, through to its execution. Therefore, investment firms should keep records of all their orders and all their transactions in financial instruments, and operators of platforms are required to keep records of all orders submitted to their systems. ESMA should coordinate the exchange of information among competent authorities to ensure that they have access to all records of transactions and orders, including those entered on platforms that operate outside their territory, in financial instruments under their supervision.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>Double reporting of the same information should be avoided. Reports submitted to trade repositories registered or recognised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012 for the relevant financial instruments which contain all the required information for transaction reporting purposes should not need to be reported to competent authorities, but should be transmitted to them by the trade repositories. Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012 should be amended to that effect.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>Any exchange or transmission of information by competent authorities should be in accordance with the rules on the transfer of personal data as laid down in Directive 95/46/EC. Any exchange or transmission of information by ESMA should be in accordance with the rules on the transfer of personal data as laid down in Regulation (EC) No&nbsp;45/2001, which should be fully applicable to the processing of personal data for the purposes of this Regulation.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012 lays down the criteria according to which classes of OTC derivatives should be subject to the clearing obligation. It prevents competitive distortions by requiring non-discriminatory access to CCPs offering clearing of OTC derivatives to trading venues and non-discriminatory access to the trade feeds of trading venues to CCPs offering clearing of OTC derivatives. As OTC derivatives are defined as derivative contracts whose execution does not take place on a regulated market, there is a need to introduce similar requirements for regulated markets under this Regulation. Derivatives traded on regulated markets should also be centrally cleared.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>In addition to requirements in Directive 2004/39/EC and in Directive 2014/65/EU that prevent Member States from unduly restricting access to post-trade infrastructure such as CCP and settlement arrangements, it is necessary that this Regulation removes various other commercial barriers that can be used to prevent competition in the clearing of financial instruments. To avoid any discriminatory practices, CCPs should accept to clear transactions executed in different trading venues, to the extent that those venues comply with the operational and technical requirements established by the CCP, including the risk management requirements. Access should be granted by a CCP if certain access criteria specified in regulatory technical standards are met. With regard to newly established CCPs that have been authorised or recognised for a period of less than three years at the point of entry into force of this Regulation, with respect to transferable securities and money market instruments, there should be the possibility for competent authorities to approve a transitional period of up to two-and-a-half years before they are exposed to full non-discriminatory access in relation to transferable securities and money market instruments. However, if a CCP chooses to avail of the transitional arrangement it should not be able to benefit from the access rights to a trading venue under this Regulation for the duration of the transitional arrangement. Furthermore, no trading venue with a close link to that CCP should be able to benefit from the access rights to a CCP under this Regulation for the duration of the transitional arrangement.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012 lays down the conditions under which non-discriminatory access between CCPs and trading venues should be granted for OTC derivatives. Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012 defines OTC derivatives as derivatives whose execution does not take place on a regulated market or on a third-country market considered as equivalent to a regulated market in accordance with Article 19(6) of Directive 2004/39/EC. In order to avoid any gaps or overlaps and to ensure consistency between Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012 and this Regulation, the requirements set out in this Regulation on non-discriminatory access between CCPs and trading venues apply to derivatives traded on regulated markets or on a third-country market considered as equivalent to a regulated market in accordance with Directive 2014/65/EU and all non-derivative financial instruments.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>Trading venues should be required to provide access including data feeds on a transparent and non-discriminatory basis to CCPs that wish to clear transactions executed on a trading venue. However, this should not necessitate the use of interoperability arrangements for clearing transactions in derivatives or create liquidity fragmentation in a way that would threaten the smooth and orderly functioning of markets. Access should only be denied by a trading venue if certain access criteria specified in regulatory technical standards are not met. With regard to exchange-traded derivatives, it would be disproportionate to require smaller trading venues, particularly those closely linked to CCPs, to comply with non-discriminatory access requirements immediately if they have not yet acquired the technological capability to engage on a level playing field with the majority of the post-trade infrastructure market. Therefore trading venues below the relevant threshold should have the option of exempting themselves, and therefore their associated CCPs, from non-discriminatory access requirements in respect of exchange-traded derivatives for a period of 30 months with the possibility of subsequent renewals. However, if a trading venue chooses to exempt itself, it should not be able to benefit from the access rights to a CCP under this Regulation for the duration of the exemption.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, no CCP with a close link to that trading venue should be able to benefit from the access rights to a trading venue under this Regulation for the duration of the exemption. Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012 identifies that where commercial and intellectual property rights relate to financial services related to derivative contracts, licenses should be available on proportionate, fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. Therefore, access to licences of, and information relating to, benchmarks that are used to determine the value of financial instruments should be provided to CCPs and other trading venues on a proportionate, fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis and any license should be on reasonable commercial terms. Without prejudice to the application of competition rules, where any new benchmark is developed following the entry into force of this Regulation an obligation to licence should start 30 months after a financial instrument referencing that benchmark commenced trading or was admitted to trading. Access to licenses is critical to facilitate access between trading venues and CCPs under Article 35 and 36 as otherwise licensing arrangements could still prevent access between trading venues and CCPs that they have requested access to.</p>
               <p>The removal of barriers and discriminatory practices is intended to increase competition for clearing and trading of financial instruments in order to lower investment and borrowing costs, eliminate inefficiencies and foster innovation in Union markets. The Commission should continue to closely monitor the evolution of post-trade infrastructure and should, where necessary, intervene in order to prevent competitive distortions from occurring in the internal market, in particular where the refusal of access to infrastructure or to benchmarks contravenes Articles 101 or 102 TFEU. The licencing duties under this Regulation should be without prejudice to the general obligation of proprietary owners of benchmarks under Union competition law, and under Articles 101 and 102 TFEU in particular, concerning access to benchmarks that are indispensable to enter a new market. Approvals of competent authorities to not apply access rights for transitional periods are not authorisations or amendments of authorisations.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>The provision of services by third-country firms in the Union is subject to national regimes and requirements. Those regimes are highly differentiated and the firms authorised in accordance with them do not enjoy the freedom to provide services and the right of establishment in Member States other than the one where they are established. It is appropriate to introduce a common regulatory framework at Union level. The regime should harmonise the existing fragmented framework, ensure certainty and uniform treatment of third-country firms accessing the Union, ensure that an assessment of effective equivalence has been carried out by the Commission in relation to the prudential and business conduct framework of third countries, and should provide for a comparable level of protection to clients in the Union receiving services by third-country firms.</p>
               <p>In applying the regime the Commission and Member States should prioritise the areas covered by the G-20 commitments and agreements with the Union&rsquo;s largest trading partners and should have regard to the central role that the Union plays in worldwide financial markets and ensure that the application of third-country requirements does not prevent Union investors and issuers from investing in or obtaining funding from third countries or third-country investors and issuers from investing, raising capital or obtaining other financial services in Union markets unless that is necessary for objective and evidence-based prudential reasons. In carrying out the assessments, the Commission should have regard to the International Organisation of Securities Commission&rsquo;s (IOSCO) Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation and its recommendations as amended and interpreted by IOSCO.</p>
               <p>Where a decision cannot be made determining effective equivalence, the provision of services by third-country firms in the Union remains subject to national regimes. The Commission should initiate the equivalence assessment on its own initiative. Member States should be able to indicate their interest that a certain third-country or certain third countries are subject to the equivalence assessment carried out by the Commission, without such indications being binding on the Commission to initiate the equivalence process. The equivalence assessment should be outcome-based; it should assess to what extent the respective third-country regulatory and supervisory framework achieves similar and adequate regulatory effects and to what extent it meets the same objectives as Union law. When initiating those equivalence assessments, the Commission should be able to prioritise among third-country jurisdictions taking into account the materiality of the equivalence finding to Union firms and clients, the existence of supervisory and cooperation agreements between the third country and the Member States, the existence of an effective equivalent system for the recognition of investment firms authorised under foreign regimes as well as the interest and willingness of the third country to engage in the equivalence assessment process. The Commission should monitor any significant changes to the regulatory and supervisory framework of the third country and review the equivalence decisions where appropriate.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>Under this Regulation, the provision of services without branches should be limited to eligible counterparties and professional clients per se. It should be subject to registration by ESMA and to supervision in the third country. Proper cooperation arrangements should be in place between ESMA and the competent authorities in the third country.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>The provisions of this Regulation regulating the provision of services or undertaking of activities by third-country firms should not affect the possibility for persons established in the Union to receive investment services by a third-country firm at their own exclusive initiative or for Union investment firms or credit institutions to receive investment services or activities from a third-country firm at their own exclusive initiative or for a client to receive investment services from a third-country firm at their own exclusive initiative through the mediation of such a credit institution or investment firm. Where a third-country firm provides services at the own exclusive initiative of a person established in the Union, the services should not be deemed as provided in the territory of the Union. Where a third-country firm solicits clients or potential clients in the Union or promotes or advertises investment services or activities together with ancillary services in the Union, it should not be deemed as a service provided at the own exclusive initiative of the client.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>With regard to the recognition of third-country firms, and in accordance with the Union&rsquo;s international obligations under the agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation, including the General Agreement on Trade in Services, decisions determining third-country regulatory and supervisory frameworks as equivalent to the regulatory and supervisory framework of the Union should be adopted only if the legal and supervisory framework of the third country provides for an effective equivalent system for the recognition of investment firms authorised under foreign legal regimes in accordance with, amongst others, the general regulatory goals and standards set out by the G-20 in September 2009 of improving transparency in the derivatives markets, mitigating systemic risk, and protecting against market abuse. Such a system should be considered equivalent if it ensures that the substantial result of the applicable regulatory framework is similar to Union requirements and should be considered effective if those rules are being applied in a consistent manner.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>A range of fraudulent practices have occurred in spot secondary markets in emission allowances (EUA) which could undermine trust in the emissions trading scheme, set up by Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council<a href="#ntr14-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0014" id="ntc14-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0014" shape="rect">&nbsp;(<span class="super">14</span>)</a>, and measures are being taken to strengthen the system of EUA registries and conditions for opening an account to trade EUAs. In order to reinforce the integrity and safeguard the efficient functioning of those markets, including comprehensive supervision of trading activity, it is appropriate to complement measures taken under Directive 2003/87/EC by bringing emission allowances fully into the scope of this Regulation and Directive 2014/65/EU as well as of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and the Council<a href="#ntr15-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0015" id="ntc15-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0015" shape="rect">&nbsp;(<span class="super">15</span>)</a> and of Directive 2014/57/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council<a href="#ntr16-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0016" id="ntc16-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0016" shape="rect">&nbsp;(<span class="super">16</span>)</a>, by classifying them as financial instruments.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>The Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of TFEU. In particular, the delegated acts should be adopted in respect of the extension of the scope of certain provisions of this Regulation to third-country central banks, specific details concerning definitions, specific cost-related provisions related to the availability of market data, access to quotes, the sizes at or below which a firm shall enter into transactions with any other client to whom a quote is available, portfolio compression and the further determination of when there is a significant investor protection concern or a threat to investor protection, the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or commodity markets or to the stability of the whole or part of the financial system of the Union may warrant ESMA, EBA or competent authorities&rsquo; action, position management powers of ESMA, the extension of the transitional period under Article 35(5) of this Regulation for a certain period of time and in respect of the exclusion of exchange-traded derivatives from the scope of certain provisions of this Regulation for a certain period of time. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission relating to the adoption of the equivalence decision concerning the third-country legal and supervisory framework for the provision of services by third-country firms or third-country trading venues for the purpose of eligibility as trading venues for derivatives subject to the trading obligation and of access of third-country CCPs and third-country trading venues to trading venues and CCPs established in the Union. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council<a href="#ntr17-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0017" id="ntc17-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0017" shape="rect">&nbsp;(<span class="super">17</span>)</a>.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to establish uniform requirements relating to financial instruments in relation to disclosure of trade data, reporting of transactions to the competent authorities, trading of derivatives and shares on organised venues, non-discriminatory access to CCPs, trading venues and benchmarks, product intervention powers and powers on position management and position limits, provision of investment services or activities by third-country firms, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, because, although national competent authorities are better placed to monitor market developments, the overall impact of the problems related to trade transparency, transaction reporting, derivatives trading, and bans of products and practices can only be fully understood in a Union-wide context, but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at the Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>No action taken by any competent authority or ESMA in the performance of their duties should directly or indirectly discriminate against any Member State or group of Member States as a venue for the provision of investment services and activities in any currency. No action taken by EBA in the performance of its duties under this Regulation should directly or indirectly discriminate against any Member State or group of Member States.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>Technical standards in financial services should ensure adequate protection of depositors, investors and consumers across the Union. As a body with highly specialised expertise, it would be efficient and appropriate to entrust ESMA, with the elaboration of draft regulatory technical standards which do not involve policy choices, for submission to the Commission.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>The Commission should adopt the draft regulatory technical standards developed by ESMA regarding the precise characteristics of trade transparency requirements, regarding the monetary, foreign exchange and financial stability policy operations and the types of the certain transactions relevant under this Regulation, regarding the detailed conditions for waivers from pre-trade transparency, regarding deferred post-trade publication arrangements, regarding the obligation to make pre-trade and post-trade data available separately, regarding the criteria for the application of the pre-trade transparency obligations for systematic internalisers, regarding post-trade disclosure by investment firms, regarding the content and frequency of data requests for the provision of information for the purposes of transparency and other calculations, regarding transactions that do not contribute to the price discovery process, regarding the order data to be retained, regarding the content and specifications of transaction reports, regarding the content and specification of financial instrument reference data, regarding the types of contracts which have a direct, substantial and foreseeable effect within the Union and the cases where the trading obligation for derivatives is necessary, regarding the requirements for systems and procedures to ensure that transactions in cleared derivatives are submitted and accepted for clearing, specifying types of indirect clearing service arrangements, regarding derivatives subject to an obligation to trade on organised trading venues, regarding non-discriminatory access to a CCP and to a trading venue, regarding non-discriminatory access to and obligation to licence benchmarks, and concerning the information that the applicant third-country firm should provide to ESMA in its application for registration. The Commission should adopt those draft regulatory technical standards by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU and in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;1093/2010.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>Article 95 of Directive 2014/65/EU provides for a transitional exemption for certain C6 energy derivative contracts. It is therefore necessary that the technical standards specifying the clearing obligation developed by ESMA in accordance with Article 5(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012 take that into account and do not impose a clearing obligation on derivative contracts which would subsequently be subject to the transitional exemption for C6 energy derivative contracts.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>The application of the requirements in this Regulation should be deferred in order to align applicability with the application of the transposed rules of the recast Directive and to establish all essential implementing measures. The entire regulatory package should then be applied from the same point in time. Only the application of the empowerments for implementing measures should not be deferred so that the necessary steps to draft and adopt those implementing measures can start as early as possible.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p>This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the right to the protection of personal data (Article 8), the freedom to conduct a business (Article 16), the right to consumer protection (Article 38), the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial (Article 47), and the right not to be tried or punished twice for the same offence (Article 50), and has to be applied in accordance with those rights and principles.</p>

               <p>The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 28(2) of Regulation (EC) No&nbsp;45/2001 and delivered an opinion on 10 February 2012<a href="#ntr18-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0018" id="ntc18-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0018" shape="rect">&nbsp;(<span class="super">18</span>)</a>,</p>

   <li><p>This Regulation applies to investment firms, authorised under Directive 2014/65/EU and credit institutions authorised under Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council<a href="#ntr19-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0019" id="ntc19-L_2014173EN.01008401-E0019" shape="rect">&nbsp;(<span class="super">19</span>)</a> when providing investment services and/or performing investment activities and to market operators including any trading venues they operate.</p>
   <li><p>Title V of this Regulation also applies to all financial counterparties as defined in Article 2(8) of Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012 and to all non-financial counterparties falling under Article 10(1)(b) of that Regulation.</p>
   <li><p>Title VI of this Regulation also applies to CCPs and persons with proprietary rights to benchmarks.</p>
   <li><p>Title VIII of this Regulation applies to third-country firms providing investment services or activities within the Union following an applicable equivalence decision by the Commission with or without a branch.</p>
   <li><p>Articles 8, 10, 18 and 21 shall not apply to regulated markets, market operators and investment firms in respect of a transaction where the counterparty is a member of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and where that transaction is entered into in performance of monetary, foreign exchange and financial stability policy which that member of the ESCB is legally empowered to pursue and where that member has given prior notification to its counterparty that the transaction is exempt.</p>
   <li><p>Paragraph 6 shall not apply in respect of transactions entered into by any member of the ESCB in performance of their investment operations.</p>
   <li><p>ESMA shall, in close cooperation with the ESCB, develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the monetary, foreign exchange and financial stability policy operations and the types of transactions to which paragraphs 6 and 7 apply.</p>
   <p>ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 3 July 2015.</p>
   <p>Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;1095/2010.</p>
   <li><p>The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 50 to extend the scope of paragraph 6 to other central banks.</p>
   <p>To that end, the Commission shall, by 1 June 2015, submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council assessing the treatment of transactions by third-country central banks which for the purposes of this paragraph includes the Bank for International Settlements. The report shall include an analysis of their statutory tasks and their trading volumes in the Union. The report shall:</p>
   <ol type="a">
   <li>
               <p>identify provisions applicable in the relevant third countries regarding the regulatory disclosure of central bank transactions, including transactions undertaken by members of the ESCB in those third countries, and</p></li>
   <li>
               <p>assess the potential impact that regulatory disclosure requirements in the Union may have on third-country central bank transactions.</p></li>
    </ol>

   <p>If the report concludes that the exemption provided for in paragraph 6 is necessary in respect of transactions where the counterparty is a third-country central bank carrying out monetary policy, foreign exchange and financial stability operations, the Commission shall provide that that exemption applies to that third-country central bank.</p></li></ol>

               <p>the percentage of trading in a financial instrument carried out on a trading venue under those waivers shall be limited to 4&nbsp;% of the total volume of trading in that financial instrument on all trading venues across the Union over the previous 12 months.</p></li>

   <p>That volume cap mechanism shall not apply to negotiated transactions which are in a share, depositary receipt, ETF, certificate or other similar financial instrument for which there is not a liquid market as determined in accordance with Article 2(1)(17)(b) and are dealt within a percentage of a suitable reference price as referred to in Article 4(1)(b)(ii), or to negotiated transactions that are subject to conditions other than the current market price of that financial instrument as referred to in Article 4(1)(b)(iii).</p>
   <li><p>When the percentage of trading in a financial instrument carried out on a trading venue under the waivers has exceeded the limit referred to in paragraph 1(a), the competent authority that authorised the use of those waivers by that venue shall within two working days suspend their use on that venue in that financial instrument based on the data published by ESMA referred to in paragraph 4, for a period of six months.</p>
   <li><p>When the percentage of trading in a financial instrument carried out on all trading venues across the Union under those waivers has exceeded the limit referred to in paragraph 1(b), all competent authorities shall within two working days suspend the use of those waivers across the Union for a period of six months.</p>

   <li><p>In the event that the report referred to in paragraph 4 identifies any trading venue where trading in any financial instrument carried out under the waivers has exceeded 3,75&nbsp;% of the total trading in the Union in that financial instrument, based on the previous 12 months&rsquo; trading, ESMA shall publish an additional report within five working days of the 15th day of the calendar month in which the report referred to in paragraph 4 is published.

   <li><p>In the event that the report referred to in paragraph 4 identifies that overall Union trading in any financial instrument carried out under the waivers has exceeded 7,75&nbsp;% of the total Union trading in the financial instrument, based on the previous 12 months&rsquo; trading, ESMA shall publish an additional report within five working days of the 15th on the day of the calendar month in which the report referred to in paragraph 4 is published. That report shall contain the information specified in paragraph 4 in respect of those financial instruments where 7,75&nbsp;% has been exceeded.</p>
   <li><p>In order to ensure a reliable basis for monitoring the trading taking place under those waivers and for determining whether the limits referred to in paragraph 1 have been exceeded, operators of trading venues shall be obligated to have in place systems and procedures to:</p>

   <li>
               <p>enable the identification of all trades which have taken place on its venue under those waivers; and</p></li>

    </ol>
   <li><p>The period for the publication of trading data by ESMA, and for which trading in a financial instrument under those waivers is to be monitored shall start on 3 January 2016. Without prejudice to Article 4(5), competent authorities shall be empowered to suspend the use of those waivers from the date of application of this Regulation and thereafter on a monthly basis.</p>
   <li><p>ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the method, including the flagging of transactions, by which it collates, calculates and publishes the transaction data, as outlined in paragraph 4, in order to provide an accurate measurement of the total volume of trading per financial instrument and the percentages of trading that use those waivers across the Union and per trading venue.</p>
   <p>ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 3 July 2015.</p>

   <h6 id="d1e2088-84-1">Article 14</h6>
   <h7>Obligation for systematic internalisers to make public firm quotes in respect of shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates and other similar financial instruments</h7>
   <ol type="1"><li><p>Investment firms shall make public firm quotes in respect of those shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates and other similar financial instruments traded on a trading venue for which they are systematic internalisers and for which there is a liquid market.</p>
   <p>Where there is not a liquid market for the financial instruments referred to in the first subparagraph, systematic internalisers shall disclose quotes to their clients upon request.</p>
   <li><p>This Article and Articles 15, 16 and 17 shall apply to systematic internalisers when they deal in sizes up to standard market size. Systematic internalisers shall not be subject to this Article and Articles 15, 16 and 17 when they deal in sizes above standard market size.</p>
   <li><p>Systematic internalisers may decide the size or sizes at which they will quote. The minimum quote size shall be at least the equivalent of 10&nbsp;% of the standard market size of a share, depositary receipt, ETF, certificate or other similar financial instrument traded on a trading venue. For a particular share, depositary receipt, ETF, certificate or other similar financial instrument traded on a trading venue each quote shall include a firm bid and offer price or prices for a size or sizes which could be up to standard market size for the class of shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates or other similar financial instruments to which the financial instrument belongs. The price or prices shall reflect the prevailing market conditions for that share, depositary receipt, ETF, certificate or other similar financial instrument.</p>
   <li><p>Shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates and other similar financial instruments shall be grouped in classes on the basis of the arithmetic average value of the orders executed in the market for that financial instrument. The standard market size for each class of shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates and other similar financial instruments shall be a size representative of the arithmetic average value of the orders executed in the market for the financial instruments included in each class.</p>
   <li><p>The market for each share, depositary receipt, ETF, certificate or other similar financial instrument shall be comprised of all orders executed in the Union in respect of that financial instrument excluding those that are large in scale compared to normal market size.</p>
   <li><p>The competent authority of the most relevant market in terms of liquidity as defined in Article 26 for each share, depositary receipt, ETF, certificate and other similar financial instrument shall determine at least annually, on the basis of the arithmetic average value of the orders executed in the market in respect of that financial instrument, the class to which it belongs. That information shall be made public to all market participants and communicated to ESMA which shall publish the information on its website.</p>
   <li><p>In order to ensure the efficient valuation of shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates and other similar financial instruments and maximise the possibility of investment firms to obtain the best deal for their clients, ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify further the arrangements for the publication of a firm quote as referred to in paragraph 1, the determination of whether prices reflect prevailing market conditions as referred to in paragraph 3, and of the standard market size as referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4.</p>
   <p>ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 3 July 2015.</p>
   <p>Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;1095/2010.</p></li></ol>

   <h7>Execution of client orders</h7>
   <ol type="1"><li><p>Systematic internalisers shall make public their quotes on a regular and continuous basis during normal trading hours. They may update their quotes at any time. They shall be allowed, under exceptional market conditions, to withdraw their quotes.</p>
   <p>Member States shall require that firms that meet the definition of systematic internaliser notify their competent authority. Such notification shall be transmitted to ESMA. ESMA shall establish a list of all SIs in the Union.</p>
   <p>The quotes shall be made public in a manner which is easily accessible to other market participants on a reasonable commercial basis.</p>
   <li><p>Systematic internalisers shall, while complying with Article 27 of Directive 2014/65//EU, execute the orders they receive from their clients in relation to the shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates and other similar financial instruments for which they are systematic internalisers at the quoted prices at the time of reception of the order.</p>
   <p>However, in justified cases, they may execute those orders at a better price provided that the price falls within a public range close to market conditions.</p>
   <li><p>Systematic internalisers may execute orders they receive from their professional clients at prices different than their quoted ones without having to comply with the requirements established in paragraph 2, in respect of transactions where execution in several securities is part of one transaction or in respect of orders that are subject to conditions other than the current market price.</p>
   <li><p>Where a systematic internaliser quoting only one quote or whose highest quote is lower than the standard market size receives an order from a client of a size bigger than its quotation size, but lower than the standard market size, it may decide to execute that part of the order which exceeds its quotation size, provided that it is executed at the quoted price, except where otherwise permitted under the conditions laid down in paragraphs 2 and 3. Where the systematic internaliser is quoting in different sizes and receives an order between those sizes, which it chooses to execute, it shall execute the order at one of the quoted prices in compliance with Article 28 of Directive 2014/65/EU, except where otherwise permitted under the conditions of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article.</p>

Systematic internalisers may refuse to enter into or discontinue business relationships with clients on the basis of commercial considerations such as the client credit status, the counterparty risk and the final settlement of the transaction.</p>
   <li><p>In order to limit the risk of exposure to multiple transactions from the same client, systematic internalisers shall be allowed to limit in a non-discriminatory way the number of transactions from the same client which they undertake to enter at the published conditions. They may, in a non-discriminatory way and in accordance with Article 28 of Directive 2014/65//EU, limit the total number of transactions from different clients at the same time provided that this is allowable only where the number and/or volume of orders sought by clients considerably exceeds the norm.</p>

   <li><p>Investment firms which transmit orders shall include in the transmission of that order all the details as specified in paragraphs 1 and 3. Instead of including the mentioned details when transmitting orders, an investment firm may choose to report the transmitted order, if it is executed, as a transaction in accordance with the requirements under paragraph 1. In that case, the transaction report by the investment firm shall state that it pertains to a transmitted order.</p>
   <li><p>The operator of a trading venue shall report details of transactions in financial instruments traded on its platform which are executed through its systems by a firm which is not subject to this Regulation in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 3.</p>
   <li><p>In reporting the designation to identify the clients as required under paragraphs 3 and 4, investment firms shall use a legal entity identifier established to identify clients that are legal persons.</p>
   <p>ESMA shall develop by 3 January 2016 guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;1095/2010 to ensure that the application of legal entity identifiers within the Union complies with international standards, in particular those established by the Financial Stability Board.</p>
   <li><p>The reports shall be made to the competent authority either by the investment firm itself, an ARM acting on its behalf or by the trading venue through whose system the transaction was completed, in accordance with paragraphs 1, 3 and 9.</p>
   <p>Investment firms shall have responsibility for the completeness, accuracy and timely submission of the reports which are submitted to the competent authority.</p>
   <p>By way of derogation from that responsibility, where an investment firm reports details of those transactions through an ARM which is acting on its behalf or a trading venue, the investment firm shall not be responsible for failures in the completeness, accuracy or timely submission of the reports which are attributable to the ARM or trading venue. In those cases and subject to Article 66(4) of Directive 2014/65/EU the ARM or trading venue shall be responsible for those failures.</p>
   <p>Investment firms must nevertheless take reasonable steps to verify the completeness, accuracy and timeliness of the transaction reports which were submitted on their behalf.</p>
   <p>The home Member State shall require the trading venue, when making reports on behalf of the investment firm, to have sound security mechanisms in place designed to guarantee the security and authentication of the means of transfer of information, to minimise the risk of data corruption and unauthorised access and to prevent information leakage maintaining the confidentiality of the data at all times. The home Member State shall require the trading venue to maintain adequate resources and have back-up facilities in place in order to offer and maintain its services at all times.</p>
   <p>Trade-matching or reporting systems, including trade repositories registered or recognised in accordance with Title VI of Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012, may be approved by the competent authority as an ARM in order to transmit transaction reports to the competent authority in accordance with paragraphs 1, 3 and 9.</p>
   <p>Where transactions have been reported to a trade repository in accordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012 which is approved as an ARM and where those reports contain the details required under paragraphs 1, 3 and 9 and are transmitted to the competent authority by the trade repository within the time limit set in paragraph 1, the obligation on the investment firm laid down in paragraph 1 shall be considered to have been complied with.</p>
   <p>Where there are errors or omissions in the transaction reports, the ARM, investment firm or trading venue reporting the transaction shall correct the information and submit a corrected report to the competent authority.</p>
   <li><p>When, in accordance with Article 35(8) of Directive 2014/65/EU, reports provided for under this Article are transmitted to the competent authority of the host Member State, it shall transmit that information to the competent authorities of the home Member State of the investment firm, unless the competent authorities of the home Member State decide that they do not want to receive that information.</p>
   <li><p>ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:</p>
   <ol type="a"><li>

The Commission may take steps to propose any changes, including providing for transactions to be transmitted only to a single system appointed by ESMA instead of to competent authorities. The Commission shall forward ESMA&rsquo;s report to the European Parliament and to the Council.</p></li></ol>

   <li><p>The trading obligation shall also apply to counterparties referred to in paragraph 1 which enter into derivatives transactions pertaining to a class of derivatives that has been declared subject to the trading obligation with third-country financial institutions or other third-country entities that would be subject to the clearing obligation if they were established in the Union.

   <p>ESMA shall regularly monitor the activity in derivatives which have not been declared subject to the trading obligation as described in paragraph 1 in order to identify cases where a particular class of contracts may pose systemic risk and to prevent regulatory arbitrage between derivative transactions subject to the trading obligation and derivative transactions which are not subject to the trading obligation.</p>
   <li><p>Derivatives declared subject to the trading obligation pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be eligible to be admitted to trading on a regulated market or to trade on any trading venue as referred to in paragraph 1 on a non-exclusive and non-discriminatory basis.</p>

   <p>In preparing those draft regulatory technical standards, ESMA shall take into consideration the anticipated impact that trading obligation might have on the liquidity of a class of derivatives or a relevant subset thereof and the commercial activities of end users which are not financial entities.</p>

   <li><p>A request to access a CCP by a trading venue shall be formally submitted to a CCP, its relevant competent authority and the competent authority of the trading venue. The request shall specify to which types of financial instruments access is requested.</p>
   <li><p>The CCP shall provide a written response to the trading venue within three months in the case of transferable securities and money market instruments, and within six months in the case of exchange-traded derivatives, either permitting access, under the condition that a relevant competent authority has granted access pursuant to paragraph 4, or denying access. The CCP may deny a request for access only under the conditions specified in paragraph 6(a). If a CCP denies access it shall provide full reasons in its response and inform its competent authority in writing of the decision. Where the trading venue is established in a different Member State to the CCP, the CCP shall also provide such notification and reasoning to the competent authority of the trading venue. The CCP shall make access possible within three months of providing a positive response to the access request.</p>
   <li><p>The competent authority of the CCP or that of the trading venue shall grant a trading venue access to a CCP only where such access:</p>
   <ol type="a"><li>
               <p>would not require an interoperability arrangement, in the case of derivatives that are not OTC derivatives pursuant to Article 2(7) of Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012; or</p></li>
   <li>
               <p>would not threaten the smooth and orderly functioning of the markets, in particular due to liquidity fragmentation, or would not adversely affect systemic risk.</p></li></ol>
   <p>Nothing in point (a) of the first subparagraph shall prevent access being granted where the request referred to in paragraph 2 requires interoperability and the trading venue and all CCPs party to the proposed interoperability arrangement have consented to the arrangement and the risks to which the incumbent CCP is exposed to arising from inter-CCP positions are collateralised at a third party.</p>
   <p>Where the need for an interoperability arrangement is the reason or is part of the reason for denying a request, the trading venue will advise the CCP and inform ESMA which other CCPs have access to the trading venue and ESMA will publish that information so that investment firms may choose to exercise their rights under Article 37 of Directive 2014/65/EU in respect of those CCPs in order to facilitate alternative access arrangements.</p>
   <p>If a competent authority refuses access it shall issue its decision within two months following receipt of the request referred to in paragraph 2 and provide full reasons to the other competent authority, the CCP and the trading venue including the evidence on which the decision is based.</p>
   <li><p>As regards transferable securities and money market instruments, a CCP that has been newly established and authorised as a CCP as defined in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012 to clear under Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012 or recognised under Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012 or authorised under a pre-existing national authorisation regime for a period of less than three years on 2 July 2014 may, before 3 January 2017, apply to its competent authority for permission to avail itself of transitional arrangements. The competent authority may decide that this Article does not apply to the CCP in respect of transferable securities and money market instruments, for a transitional period until 3 July 2019.</p>
   <p>Where such a transitional period is approved, the CCP cannot benefit from the access rights under Article 36 or this Article in respect of transferable securities and money market instruments for the duration of that transitional arrangement. The competent authority shall notify members of the college of competent authorities for the CCP and ESMA when a transitional period is approved. ESMA shall publish a list of all notifications that it receives.</p>
   <p>Where a CCP which has been approved for the transitional arrangements under this paragraph is connected by close links to one or more trading venues, those trading venues shall not benefit from access rights under Article 36 or this Article in respect of transferable securities and money market instruments for the duration of the transitional arrangement.</p>
   <p>A CCP which is authorised during the three year period prior to entry into force, but is formed by a merger or acquisition involving at least one CCP authorised prior to that period, shall not be permitted to apply for the transitional arrangements under this paragraph.</p>
   <li><p>ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:</p>
   <ol type="a"><li>
               <p>the specific conditions under which an access request may be denied by a CCP, including the anticipated volume of transactions, the number and type of users, arrangements for managing operational risk and complexity or other factors creating significant undue risks;</p></li>
   <li>
               <p>the conditions under which access must be permitted by a CCP, including confidentiality of information provided regarding financial instruments during the development phase, the non-discriminatory and transparent basis as regards clearing fees, collateral requirements and operational requirements regarding margining;</p></li>
   <li>
               <p>the conditions under which granting access will threaten the smooth and orderly functioning of markets or would adversely affect systemic risk;</p></li>
   <li>
               <p>the procedure for making a notification under paragraph 5;</p></li>
   <li>
               <p>the conditions for non-discriminatory treatment in terms of how contracts traded on that trading venue are treated in terms of collateral requirements and netting of economically equivalent contracts and cross-margining with correlated contracts cleared by the same CCP.</p></li></ol>
   <p>ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 3 July 2015.</p>
   <p>Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;1095/2010.</p></li></ol>

   <h7>Non-discriminatory access to a trading venue</h7>
   <ol type="1"><li><p>Without prejudice to Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012, a trading venue shall provide trade feeds on a non-discriminatory and transparent basis, including as regards fees related to access, upon request to any CCP authorised or recognised by Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012 that wishes to clear transactions in financial instruments that are concluded on that trading venue. That requirement does not apply to any derivative contract that is already subject to the access obligations under Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012.</p>
   <p>A trading venue is not bound by this Article if it is connected by close links to a CCP which has given notification that it is availing of the transitional arrangements under Article 35(5).</p>
   <li><p>A request to access a trading venue by a CCP shall be formally submitted to a trading venue, its relevant competent authority and the competent authority of the CCP.</p>
   <li><p>The trading venue shall provide a written response to the CCP within three months in the case of transferable securities and money market instruments, and within six months in the case of exchange-traded derivatives, either permitting access, under the condition that the relevant competent authority has granted access pursuant to paragraph 4, or denying access. The trading venue may deny access only under the conditions specified under paragraph 6(a). When access is denied the trading venue shall provide full reasons in its response and inform its competent authority in writing of the decision. Where the CCP is established in a different Member State to the trading venue, the trading venue shall also provide such notification and reasoning to the competent authority of the CCP. The trading venue shall make access possible within three months of providing a positive response to the access request.</p>
   <li><p>The competent authority of the trading venue or that of the CCP shall grant a CCP access to a trading venue only where such access:</p>
   <ol type="a"><li>
               <p>would not require an interoperability arrangement, in the case of derivatives that are not OTC derivatives pursuant to Article 2(7) of Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012; or</p></li>
   <li>
               <p>would not threaten the smooth and orderly functioning of the markets, in particular due to liquidity fragmentation and the trading venue has put in place adequate mechanisms to prevent such fragmentation, or would not adversely affect systemic risk.</p></li></ol>
   <p>Nothing in point (a) of the first subparagraph shall prevent access being granted where the request referred to in paragraph 2 requires interoperability and the trading venue and all CCPs party to the proposed interoperability arrangement have consented to the arrangement and the risks to which the incumbent CCP is exposed to arising from inter-CCP positions are collateralised at a third party.</p>
   <p>Where the need for an interoperability arrangement is the reason or is part of the reason for denying a request, the trading venue will advise the CCP and inform ESMA which other CCPs have access to the trading venue and ESMA will publish that information so that investment firms may choose to exercise their rights under Article 37 of Directive 2014/65/EU in respect of those CCPs in order to facilitate alternative access arrangements.</p>
   <p>If a competent authority denies access it shall issue its decision within two months following receipt of the request referred to in paragraph 2 and provide full reasons to the other competent authority, the trading venue and the CCP including the evidence on which its decision is based.</p>
   <li><p>As regards exchange-traded derivatives, a trading venue which falls below the relevant threshold in the calendar year preceding the entry into application of this Regulation, may, before the entry into application of this Regulation, notify ESMA and its competent authority that it does not wish to be bound by this Article for exchange-traded derivatives included within that threshold, for a period of thirty months from the application of this Regulation. A trading venue which remains below the relevant threshold in every year of that, or any further, thirty month period may, at the end of the period, notify ESMA and its competent authority that it wishes to continue to not be bound by this Article for further thirty months. Where notification is given the trading venue cannot benefit from the access rights under Article 35 or this Article for exchange-traded derivatives included within the relevant threshold, for the duration of the opt-out. ESMA shall publish a list of all notifications that it receives.</p>
   <p>The relevant threshold for the opt-out is an annual notional amount traded of EUR&nbsp;1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000 million. The notional amount shall be single-counted and shall include all transactions in exchange-traded derivatives concluded under the rules of the trading venue.</p>
   <p>Where a trading venue is part of a group which is connected by close links, the threshold shall be calculated by adding the annual notional amount traded of all the trading venues in the group as a whole that are based in the Union.</p>
   <p>Where a trading venue which has made a notification under this paragraph is connected by close links to one or more CCPs, those CCPs shall not benefit from access rights under Article 35 or this Article for exchange-traded derivatives within the relevant threshold, for the duration of the opt-out.</p>
   <li><p>ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:</p>
   <ol type="a"><li>
               <p>the specific conditions under which an access request may be denied by a trading venue, including conditions based on the anticipated volume of transactions, the number of users, arrangements for managing operational risk and complexity or other factors creating significant undue risks;</p></li>

   <li>
               <p>the procedure for making a notification under paragraph 5, including further specifications for calculation of the notional amount and the method by which ESMA may verify the calculation of the volumes and approve the opt-out.</p></li></ol>

   <h7>Non-discriminatory access to and obligation to licence benchmarks</h7>
   <ol type="1"><li><p>Where the value of any financial instrument is calculated by reference to a benchmark, a person with proprietary rights to the benchmark shall ensure that CCPs and trading venues are permitted, for the purposes of trading and clearing, non-discriminatory access to:</p>
   <ol type="a"><li>
               <p>relevant price and data feeds and information on the composition, methodology and pricing of that benchmark for the purposes of clearing and trading; and</p></li>
   <li>
               <p>licences.</p></li></ol>
   <p>A licence including access to information shall be granted on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis within three months following the request by a CCP or a trading venue.</p>
   <p>Access shall be given at a reasonable commercial price taking into account the price at which access to the benchmark is granted or the intellectual property rights are licensed on equivalent terms to another CCP, trading venues or any related persons for the purposes of clearing and trading. Different prices can be charged to different CCPs, trading venues or any related persons only where objectively justified having regard to reasonable commercial grounds such as the quantity, scope or field of use demanded.</p>
   <li><p>Where a new benchmark is developed after 3 January 2017 the obligation to licence starts no later than 30 months after a financial instrument referencing that benchmark commenced trading or was admitted to trading. Where a person with proprietary rights to a new benchmark owns an existing benchmark, that person shall establish that compared to any such existing benchmark the new benchmark meets the following cumulative criteria:</p>
   <ol type="a"><li>
               <p>the new benchmark is not a mere copy or adaptation of any such existing benchmark and the methodology, including the underlying data, of the new benchmark is meaningfully different from any such existing benchmark; and</p></li>
   <li>
               <p>the new benchmark is not a substitute for any such existing benchmark.</p></li></ol>
   <p>This paragraph shall be without prejudice to the application of competition rules and, in particular, Article 101 and 102 TFEU.</p>
   <li><p>No CCP, trading venue or related entity may enter into an agreement with any provider of a benchmark the effect of which would be either:</p>
   <ol type="a"><li>
               <p>to prevent any other CCP or trading venue from obtaining access to such information or rights as referred to in paragraph 1; or</p></li>
   <li>
               <p>to prevent any other CCP or trading venue from obtaining access to such a licence, as referred to in paragraph 1.</p></li></ol>
   <li><p>ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:</p>
   <ol type="a"><li>
               <p>the information through licensing to be made available under paragraph 1(a) for the sole use of the CCP or trading venue;</p></li>

   <li><p>CCPs and trading venues established in third countries may only request a licence and the access rights in accordance with Article 37 provided that the Commission has adopted a decision in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article that the legal and supervisory framework of that third country is considered to provide for an effective equivalent system under which CCPs and trading venues authorised in foreign jurisdictions are permitted access on a fair reasonable and non-discriminatory basis to:</p>

   <li><p>ESMA shall register a third-country firm that has applied for the provision of investment services or performance of activities throughout the Union in accordance with paragraph 1 only where the following conditions are met:</p>
   <ol type="a"><li>
               <p>the Commission has adopted a decision in accordance with Article 47(1);</p></li>
   <li>
               <p>the firm is authorised in the jurisdiction where its head office is established to provide the investment services or activities to be provided in the Union and it is subject to effective supervision and enforcement ensuring a full compliance with the requirements applicable in that third country;</p></li>
   <li>
               <p>cooperation arrangements have been established pursuant to Article 47(2).</p></li></ol>
   <li><p>Where a third-country firm is registered in accordance with this Article, Member States shall not impose any additional requirements on the third-country firm in respect of matters covered by this Regulation or by Directive 2014/65/EU and shall not treat third-country firms more favourably than Union firms.</p>
   <li><p>The third-country firm referred to in paragraph 1 shall submit its application to ESMA after the adoption by the Commission of the decision referred to in Article 47 determining that the legal and supervisory framework of the third country in which the third-country firm is authorised is equivalent to the requirements described in Article 47(1).</p>
   <p>The applicant third-country firm shall provide ESMA with all information necessary for its registration. Within 30 working days of receipt of the application, ESMA shall assess whether the application is complete. If the application is not complete, ESMA shall set a deadline by which the applicant third-country firm is to provide additional information.</p>
   <p>The registration decision shall be based on the conditions set out in paragraph 2.</p>
   <p>Within 180 working days of the submission of a complete application, ESMA shall inform the applicant third-country firm in writing with a fully reasoned explanation whether the registration has been granted or refused.</p>
   <p>Member States may allow third-country firms to provide investment services or perform investment activities together with ancillary services to eligible counterparties and professional clients within the meaning of Section I of Annex II to Directive 2014/65/EU in their territories in accordance with national regimes in the absence of the Commission decision in accordance with Article 47(1) or where such decision is no longer in effect.</p>

An initiative by such clients shall not entitle the third-country firm to market new categories of investment product or investment service to that individual.</p>
   <li><p>Third-country firms providing services or performing activities in accordance with this Article shall, before providing any service or performing any activity in relation to a client established in the Union, offer to submit any disputes relating to those services or activities to the jurisdiction of a court or arbitral tribunal in a Member State.</p>

   <li><p>A third-country firm may no longer use the rights under Article 46(1) where the Commission adopts a decision in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 51(2) withdrawing its decision under paragraph 1 of this Article in relation to that third country.</p></li></ol>

   <h7>Reports and review</h7>
   <ol type="1"><li><p>By 3 March 2019, the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the impact in practice of the transparency obligations established pursuant to Articles 3 to 13, in particular on the impact of the volume cap mechanism described in Article 5, including on the cost of trading for eligible counterparties and professional clients and on trading of shares of small and mid-cap companies, and its effectiveness in ensuring that the use of the relevant waivers does not harm price formation and how any appropriate mechanism for imposing sanctions for infringements of the volume cap might operate, and on the application and continued appropriateness of the waivers to pre-trade transparency obligations established pursuant to Article 4(2) and (3) and Article 9(2) to (5).</p>
   <li><p>The report referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the impact on European equity markets of the use of the waiver under Article 4(1)(a) and (b)(i) and the volume cap mechanism under Article 5, with particular reference to:</p>
   <ol type="a"><li>
               <p>the level and trend of non-lit order book trading within the Union since the introduction of this Regulation;</p></li>
   <li>
               <p>the impact on the pre-trade transparent quoted spreads;</p></li>
   <li>
               <p>the impact on the depth of liquidity on lit order books;</p></li>
   <li>
               <p>the impact on competition and on investors within the Union;</p></li>
   <li>
               <p>the impact on trading of shares of small and mid-cap companies;</p></li>
   <li>
               <p>developments at international level and discussions with third countries and international organisations.</p></li></ol>
   <li><p>If the report concludes that the use of the waiver under Article 4(1)(a) and (b)(i) is harmful to price formation or to trading of shares of small and mid-cap companies, the Commission shall, where appropriate, make proposals, including amendments to this Regulation, regarding the use of those waivers. Such proposals shall include an impact assessment of the proposed amendments, and shall take into account the objectives of this Regulation and the effects on market disruption and competition, and potential impacts on investors in the Union.</p>
   <li><p>By 3 March 2019, the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the functioning of Article 26, including whether the content and format of transaction reports received and exchanged between competent authorities comprehensively enable to monitor the activities of investment firms in accordance with Article 26(1). The Commission may make any appropriate proposals, including providing for transactions to be reported to a system appointed by ESMA instead of to competent authorities, which allows relevant competent authorities to access all the information reported pursuant to this Article for the purposes of this Regulation and of Directive 2014/65/EU and the detection of insider dealing and market abuse in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 596/2014.</p>
   <li><p>By 3 March 2019, the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on appropriate solutions to reduce information asymmetries between market participants as well as tools for regulators to better monitor quotation activities on trading venues. That report shall at least assess the feasibility of developing a European best bid and offer system for consolidated quotes to fulfil those objectives.</p>
   <li><p>By 3 March 2019, the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the progress made in moving trading in standardised OTC derivatives to exchanges or electronic trading platforms pursuant to Articles 25 and 28.</p>
   <li><p>By 3 July 2019, the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the development in prices for pre-trade and post-trade transparency data from regulated markets, MTFs, OTFs, APAs and CTPs.</p>
   <li><p>By 3 July 2019, the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council reviewing the interoperability provisions in Article 36 of this Regulation and of Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012.</p>
   <li><p>By 3 July 2019, the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the application of Articles 35 and 36 of this Regulation and of Articles 7 and 8 of Regulation (EU) No&nbsp;648/2012.</p>
   <p>By 3 July 2021, the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the application of Article 37.</p>
   <li><p>By 3 July 2019, the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the impact of Article 35 and 36 of this Regulation on newly established and authorised CCPs as referred to in Article 35(5) and trading venues connected to those CCPs by close links and whether the transitional arrangement provided for in Article 35(5) shall be extended, weighing the possible benefits to consumers of improving competition and the degree of choice available to market participants against the possible disproportionate effect of those provisions on newly established and authorised CCPs and the constraints of local market participants in accessing global CCPs and the smooth functioning of the market.</p>
   <p>Subject to the conclusions of that report, the Commission may adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 50 to extend the transitional period in accordance with Article 35(5) by a maximum of 30 months.</p>
   <li><p>By 3 July 2019, the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on whether the threshold laid down in Article 36(5) remains appropriate and whether the opt out mechanism in respect of exchange-traded derivatives is to remain available.</p>
   <li><p>By 3 July 2016, the Commission shall, based on a risk assessment carried out by ESMA in consultation with the ESRB, submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council assessing the need to temporarily exclude exchange-traded derivatives from the scope of Article 35 and 36. That report shall take into account risks, if any, resulting from open access provisions regarding exchange-traded derivatives to the overall stability and orderly functioning of the financial markets throughout the Union.</p>
   <p>Subject to the conclusions of that report, the Commission may adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 50 to exclude exchange-traded derivatives from the scope of Articles 35 and 36 for up to thirty months following 3 January 2017.</p>

   <li><p>If the Commission assesses that there is not a need to exclude exchange-traded derivatives from the scope of Articles 35 and 36 in accordance with Article 52(12), a CCP or a trading venue may, before the entry into application of this Regulation, apply to its competent authority for permission to avail itself of transitional arrangements. The competent authority, taking into account the risks resulting from the application of the access rights under Article 35 or 36 as regards exchange-traded derivatives to the orderly functioning of the relevant CCP or trading venue, may decide that Article 35 or 36 would not apply to the relevant CCP or trading venue, respectively, in respect of exchange-traded derivatives, for a transitional period until 3 July 2019. Where such a transitional period is approved, the CCP or trading venue cannot benefit from the access rights under Article 35 or 36, as regards exchange-traded derivatives for the duration of that transitional period. The competent authority shall notify ESMA, and in the case of a CCP the college of competent authorities for that CCP, when a transitional period is approved.</p>
   <p>Where a CCP which has been approved for the transitional arrangements, is connected by close links to one or more trading venues, those trading venues shall not benefit from access rights under Article 35 or 36 for exchange-traded derivatives for the duration of that transitional period.</p>
