readable MiFIR
==============

While reading MiFIR is a treat, it's not exactly easy to browse. This project attempts to simplify searching MiFIR and its corresponding delegated regulations.

This should go without saying, but do _not_ rely on any version of MiFIR other than the one published in the European Journal.

Project goals
-------------
- clean, responsive design
- accessibility (screen reader compatibility, no javascript dependencies)
- links to relevant delegated regulations
- proper page navigation (jumps to articles from index and back)
- links to definitions
- proper HTML semantics
